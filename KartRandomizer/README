Kart Randomizer v2.2

Trying to spice up your Mario Kart Wii experience?
This Java app lets you pick up to four players and then randomizes the character and their vehicle for each player and picks 4* random tracks.
(assumes all characters, vehicles, and tracks are unlocked)

v2.0 Update: New GUI with repeatable randomizing
v1.3 Update: Created new UI

v1.1.2 Hotfix: unique random characters
v1.1.1 Hotfix: unique random tracks

TODO:

***TOP PRIORITY** 


**Normal Priority**
- checkbox for randomizing tracks 
- about button to show description (top part of this readme), version history, authors, etc.

- "Cooler" fonts, colors, etc for big update (the one with top priority feature)
