Kart Randomizer v2.1

Trying to spice up your Mario Kart Wii experience?
This Java app lets you pick up to four players and then randomizes the character and their vehicle for each player and picks 4* random tracks.
(assumes all characters, vehicles, and tracks are unlocked)

v2.1.1 Update: Includes track dropdown (WIP)
v2.1 Update: Includes Luigi Circuit checkbox (default value checked)
v2.0 Update: New GUI with repeatable randomizing
v1.3 Update: Created new UI
v1.2 Update: fixed all hotfixes for unique randomness within characters and tracks
v1.1.2 Hotfix: unique random characters
v1.1.1 Hotfix: unique random tracks
v1.1 Update: now includes track randomizer (3 random preceding Luigi Circuit)


TODO:

***TOP PRIORITY** 
-Run track randomization to where the tracks 
are not reused until all 32 are used. 
(Does not have to carry over between closings of the application,session only)

**Normal Priority**
- checkbox for randomizing tracks 
- adaptive frame for various track amounts.
- include Luigi Circuit in random sack if checkbox is NOT checked

*low priority*
- have checkbox for including CTGP tracks (found at: http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/CTGP_Revolution#Tracks)
- "Cooler" fonts, colors, etc for big update (the one with top priority feature)
- remove unused code
- code commenting and Javadoc
